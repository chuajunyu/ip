Let's get this over with. What do you want?

Fine. I'll add 'task 1' to the list.

        [T][ ] task 1

Just what you needed to boost your list to a grand total of 1 task. Lucky you.

Fine. I'll add 'task 2' to the list.

        [D][ ] task 2 (by: Sunday)

Now your list is up to 2 tasks. Because who doesn't love more deadlines.

Fine. I'll add 'task 3 ' to the list.

        [E][ ] task 3 (from: Today to: next week)

Your list is now at 3 tasks. Maybe you'll get around to actually doing them.

Nice. You actually did something. I've marked that task as done:

        [T][X] task 1

Oh, having second thoughts? OK, I've marked that task as not done yet:

        [T][ ] task 1

Clearly, you're still undecided.

Ugh, here's what you've got so far:

1. [T][ ] task 1
2. [D][X] task 2 (by: Sunday)
3. [E][ ] task 3 (from: Today to: next week)

Can we be done now?
